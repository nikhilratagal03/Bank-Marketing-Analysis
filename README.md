## 🧼 Data Cleaning (Python)

Performed the following preprocessing steps:
- Removed null/missing values
- Converted categorical data into appropriate formats
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Filtered out invalid or irrelevant records
- Exported cleaned data to cleaned/ directory for Power BI

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Highlights

- *Distribution of Calls per Day vs Campaign Success*  
  Tracks average call volume and campaign performance by day.

- *Targeting Performance by Month / Contact Method*  
  Identifies the most effective months and contact methods (cellular, telephone, unknown).

- *Subscription Rate by Job Role*  
  Visualizes which occupations are more likely to subscribe.

- *Interactive Filters*  
  Enables slicing data by education, housing, loan, and previous campaign outcome.

## 📌 Key Insights

- Job roles like *admin, **technician, and **blue-collar* show varied subscription rates.
- Campaigns performed better in *summer months* (May, June, August).
- *Cellular* contact method outperformed other methods.
- Days with moderate call volume yielded higher success rates.

## 🧠 Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience in *data cleaning with Python*.
- Built dynamic and interactive *dashboards in Power BI*.
- Interpreted real-world marketing data to derive actionable insights.
